See package.json "scripts" entry for the full command.
To run individual tests, use mocha tests/my-test.js --grep 'my test'.

To browse the code coverage report, use:

    $ open coverage/lcov-report/index.html

# TODOs

* Test on a large (100MB) file that was not generated by this library
* Codestyle
* tests for edgecases / malformed input?
* add lint command prior to running tests
* add line numbers to errors
* remove console.logs
* implement streaming interface on parser, so you can pipe to it
* review/test error handling paths
* Prune code or get 100% coverage? (add comments in git)

# Notes

## sprintf syntax

python: 

    "B%.4d%s\n" % (1, "two") => 'B0001two\n'

javascript (using sprintf-js):

change %.4d to %04d

    sprintf("B%'04d%s\n", 1, "two") => 'B0001two\n'
